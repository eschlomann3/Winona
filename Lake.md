# Lake Life

If you would like to have a more to do out in the sun there are a lot of lakes that you can have enjoyable activites! The 
first is Winona's lake park. This has a beach, rose garden, picnic sites, dock for boating and fishing, playgrounds, five miles (paved) 
around the lake for riding bikes,or walking, and there is a place where you can rent kayaks or paddle boarding! This park is beautiful in 
summer even if you want to go have a nice picnic or walk around!
