  There are a lot of outdoor activities to do in Winona. There are two main hiking trails with amazing views when you reach the top!
The two are called Garvin Heights and Sugar Loaf.

  First about Garvin Heights! You can drive up the winding, mile-and-a-half, road up the bluff side. This drive is very beautiful with all 
rich oak savanna trees on the road side. Once you reach the top, there is an amazing view! And if you want to adventure a little before 
leaving, there is a flight of stairs and a dirt path that runs along the bluffs edge, to see another veiw that looks out to a valley below!
If you feel up to a hike, there is a stair case that starts at the bottom and goes all the way to the top. I've done this hike and make 
sure you don't have any plans later becasue there is a lot of beautiful sights a long the way. Well worth it when you make it to the top!
