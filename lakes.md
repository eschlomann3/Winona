# Lake Life

If you would like to have more to do out in the sun there are a lot of lakes that you can have enjoyable activities! The first is Winona's lake park. This has a beach, rose garden, picnic sites, dock for boating and fishing, playgrounds, five miles (paved) 
around the lake for riding bikes, or walking, and there is a place where you can rent kayaks or paddleboarding! This park is beautiful in summer even if you want to go have a nice picnic or walk around!

Then there is a Broken Paddle company that offers tours and rentals for kayaking and paddleboarding! While traveling this rich and relaxing stretch of the undisturbed Mississippi, this provides an adventure for anyone who attends. Even when you're on this relaxing ride, you might even get to see some bald eagles, some rare birds, and some unique animals you don't get to see in everyday life!
