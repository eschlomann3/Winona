  There are a lot of outdoor activities to do in Winona. There are two main hiking trails with amazing views when you reach the top!
The two are called Garvin Heights and Sugar Loaf.

  First about Garvin Heights! You can drive up the winding, mile-and-a-half, road up the bluff side. This drive is very beautiful with all rich oak savanna trees on the roadside. Once you reach the top, there is an amazing view! And if you want to adventure a little before 
leaving, there is a flight of stairs and a dirt path that runs along the edge of the bluff, to see another view that looks out to a valley below!
If you feel up to a hike, there is a staircase that starts at the bottom and goes all the way to the top. I've done this hike and make sure you don't have any plans later because there is a lot of beautiful sights along the way. Well worth it when you make it to the top!

Then Sugar Loaf! This is a lot of history behind this landmark. It was a result of a quarry in the late 1800s and the bluff has an old Native American legend that paints the rock as the cap of Dakota Cheif Wapahsha. Sugar Loaf reaches nearly **85 feet** tall, giving it the most distinguishing landmark. Hiking trails are leading to the bottom of the main landmark. The way to reach the top is to rock climb with gear but you can climb with your own risk if you want to free climb.
